To play Escalation mode correctly drag the TestMod folder into your Quake 4 folder.
It should be among other folders such as q4base. After that, drag all of the files that
are in the maps folder and begin with almost and place them inside the folders maps/mp
that are inside the pak002.pk4. Also drag the map folder into q4base as well. Ive included my pak002 file just incase to drag and drop inside q4base. The included
shortcut can then be used to play the game mode. Enjoy!
